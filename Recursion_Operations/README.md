# Recursion Operations in C++

This folder contains C++ programs demonstrating basic recursion operations:

- `factorial.cpp`: Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- `fibonacci.cpp`: Prints the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms using recursion.
- `Recursion_Operations.cpp`: (Placeholder or additional recursion examples can be added here.)

These examples illustrate the fundamental concept of recursion in C++ programming.
